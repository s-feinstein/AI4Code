# Kaggle G2Net â€“ Competition Entry
Detecting Continuous Gravitational Waves

[Kaggle competition entry](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/g2net-detecting-continuous-gravitational-waves) for the final project of [3253 - Machine Learning at U. Toronto](https://learn.utoronto.ca/programs-courses/courses/3253-machine-learning)

>"The goal of this competition is to find continuous gravitational-wave signals. You will develop a model sensitive enough to detect weak yet long-lasting signals emitted by rapidly-spinning neutron stars within noisy data.
>
>Your work will help scientists detect something new: a second class of gravitational waves! The first gravitational wave discoveries earned a Nobel Prize. Further study of these waves may enable scientists to learn about the structure of the most extreme stars in our universe."
